### Calculator using OOP and Module and packages

'''Complete our previous calculator to make it really pro using modules and packages.
Create an object oriented design. DISCUSS the design first.
IMPORTANT: Keep it simple, this exercise should not take more than 20 minutes. The idea is to
focus on design (what classes will you have and in which packages and modules will they live on?).
