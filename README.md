## Abstract
Inductive programming is a unique area of Artificial Intelligence focused on the task of Automatic Programming; it covers broad areas of Ai and software architecture to accomplish the creation of logical programs from incomplete specifications. Automatic Programming has been an elusive dream since the founding days of Ai with many sub-fields emerging proposed solutions, including statistical optimization methods, evolution inspired methods, and grammar based methods. Inductive synthesis of finite-state automata started in the 1970's and many early innovative works in programming were fueled by the desire for Automatic Programming. Interpreted languages, the preprocessor, automatic compiler optimizations, object oriented programming, shared dynamic libraries and modern IDEs are all descendants of the desire to automate computer programming. In this regard we are already standing on the shoulders of giants. The audacious goal of this work is to explore “completing the loop” – to posit an intelligent system that, given a short description of input and desired output, can automatically author usable software functions in a high-level programming language.
